               Hey, my name is Dexter. Are you a stranger? I probably don't like you. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to get to know me! If you sit still enough, I may sit on your lap. But be warned, if you move an inch, I will probably try to bite you. I am in a constant state of fear and apprehension, despite my family's constant reassurance. My signature look is what my family calls my "resting existential dread face" (see last photo for reference). Can you provide the comfort I demand? Fair warning: it probably won't be enough.

            <p>Hi, friends! My name is Louise, and I'm a kind and sensitive soul. Do you need emotional support? I'm here to provide it, whether you think you want it or not. In my previous life, I was neglected and lived all of my days on a chain otuside. However, I was found my some kind people from the Rescue Project who saved me, and helped me find my forever family. It turns out, I'm a pretty active dog off the chain, and I can run up to 12 miles at a time. I even helped my mom train for a half marathon! Now, I'm looking for love. Can you wine and dine me like I deserve? Better yet, bring squeaky toys!</p>

         <p>Nice to meet you, my name is Theodora, and I'm the coolest cat you've ever met. I'm a strong and independent spirit with an active social life outside of my home. I love to go outside and visit the other families in my neighborhood (I may or may not be searching for a new family). I was hit by a car this summer while out doing cat stuff, and shattered my pelvis. It cost my parent's a few thousand dollars to put me back together - and it was a month before their wedding! I guess it's a testament to how lovable I am. They tried to keep me inside after that, but I screamed constantly and uprooted the house plants until they relented and let me out again (after a successful recovery, of course). Like I said, I'm very spirited. Now that I have a new lease on life, I'm looking for love. I'm not sure how this will work out, since I tend to dislike most other creatures, but I'm willing to give it a try. Small dogs need not apply, I wouldn't be able to resist the urge to scratch your face.</p>
